👋 Hi there, my name is Mitch Da Silva and welcome to my repository.

**About me**

I'm a dual 🇿🇦 South African and 🇵🇹 Portuguese national who lives in the UK - go figure... I'm starting my data science journey and welcome any feedback about my work. 
I really enjoy sports, and exercise in the 💪gym (🏋️‍♂️lifting weights, and 🏃‍♂️cardio) and play 🏏cricket whenever possible. I'm also a big fan of 🏉rugby and ⚽football. 
More importantly, I have a wonderful ❤️family and really enjoy spending time with them. 


👀 **I’m interested in**

I'm getting to grips with all things tech related but have a particular interest in:
- Python
- SQL
- Power BI

(This is work in progress page - bear with me)
