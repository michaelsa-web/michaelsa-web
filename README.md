<h3>Hi there, 
 
 My name is Mitch Da Silva and welcome to my repository.</h3>
 
<h1>👋 About me</h1>

<p>I'm a dual 🇿🇦 South African and 🇵🇹 Portuguese national who lives in the UK - go figure... I've recently completed a Data Science course in Machine learning and AI at the University of Cambridge course. I welcome any feedback about my work. I really enjoy sports, and exercise in the 💪gym (🏋️‍♂️lifting weights, and 🏃‍♂️cardio) and play 🏏cricket, whenever possible. I'm also a big fan of 🏉rugby and ⚽football. 
More importantly, I have a wonderful ❤️family and really enjoy spending time with them.</p>

I'm getting to grips with all things tech related but have a particular interest in:

- **Python**

I don't like to complicate things. So, I'm strictly honing my skills in my 3 interests (Python, SQL & Power BI) by studying daily (weekends included) to becoming proficient and add value to any employer. 

<h1>📝 A little more and other interests</h1>
<p> I'm a multilingual sales & marketing professional with 10+ years of international experience across consultancy, property and technology. Combined with a recent programme in Data Science with Machine Learning & AI from the University of Cambridge — I bring a unique blend of commercial insight and technical skill to drive data-informed decisions. My career pivot is rooted in hands-on AI project-based learning. As a final Employer Project, I collaborated with the Bank of England to help develop an NLP-based model that identifies anomalies in financial disclosures from major banks. </p>
