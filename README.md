<h3>Hi there, 
 
 My name is Mitch Da Silva and welcome to my repository.</h3>
 
<h1>👋 About me</h1>

<p>I'm a dual 🇿🇦 South African and 🇵🇹 Portuguese national who lives in the UK - go figure... I've recently completed a Data Science course in Machine learning and AI at the University of Cambridge course. I welcome any feedback about my work. I really enjoy sports, and exercise in the 💪gym (🏋️‍♂️lifting weights, and 🏃‍♂️cardio) and play 🏏cricket, whenever possible. I'm also a big fan of 🏉rugby and ⚽football. 
More importantly, I have a wonderful ❤️family and really enjoy spending time with them.</p>

<h1>👀 I’m interested in</h1>

I'm getting to grips with all things tech related but have a particular interest in:
- **Python**
  * Data handling: Pandas, Numpy,
  * Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Wordcloud
  * Machine learning & Modelling: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Light GBM, Statsmodel (ADF test, Ljung-Box test)
  * Deep Learning & Neural Networks: Tensorflow/Keras (RNNs, LSTM, GRU), Pytorch
  * Time Series Analysis: Auto ARIMA modelling, statsmodels.tsa (ACF, PACF)
  * Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLTK, spaCy, Scikit-learn Vectorizer, BERTopic, Transformers (Hugging Face), Gensim, Phi-3.5 Mini
  * ChatGPT: OpenAI API
- **SQL:**
  * PostgreSQL
- **Power BI**

<h1>🌱 I’m currently learning</h1>

I don't like to complicate things. So, I'm strictly honing my skills in my 3 interests (Python, SQL & Power BI) by studying daily (weekends included) to becoming proficient and add value to any employer.
